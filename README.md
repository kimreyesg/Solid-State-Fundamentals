# Fundamentals of Solid State 🧪💻

This is your go-to resource for exploring the world of materials science, starting from the fundamentals. This repository provides interactive tools to master key concepts using Mathematica. Feel free to download and interact/modify it. 🚀

## Repository Purpose 🌟

- **Educational Materials**: Clear explanations of foundational Solid State and DFT concepts, like Bloch's Theorem.
- **Practical Examples**: Input files, output analyses, and visualizations.
- **Interactive Tools**: Mathematica notebooks to explore key concepts and develop an intuitive understanding of electronic properties.

## Repository Contents 📂

### 1. Foundational Concepts 📚

- **Bloch's Theorem 🌊**:
  - Explains why electrons in periodic crystals form wavefunctions with a plane-wave component modulated by a periodic function.
  - Includes notes and an interactive notebook.
 
- **The Kronig-Penney Model ⚙️**:
  - The Kronig-Penney model is a one-dimensional model of a crystal formed by an infinite arrangement of delta function potentials (attractive or repulsive).
  - In the provided Mathematica notebook, you’ll find a solution to this problem, which is a typical quantum mechanics problem.
  The notebook also illustrates the relationship between crystal momentum and electron energy.
  - Manipulating the plot will also demonstrate how bands and band gaps are formed and what happens when the potential is increased.

- **Nearly Free Electron Model 🫆**:
  - The model of electrons interacting with a weak potential is an excellent one for representing the electronic structure of many solids.
